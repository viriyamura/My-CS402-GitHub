# My-CS402-GitHub
Temp for my senior-project
This is my working on implementation RSA cryptography at 32bit key on Arduino.
And practical use example with nrf24L01 radio network to exchange encrypted data.
BigNumber Library is Arbitrary precision ported by Nick Gammon 
(http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=85692.0) for key and encryped message data type.
RF24 Library is a driver of nrf24L01 by ManiacBug (https://github.com/maniacbug/RF24)
