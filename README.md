# My-CS402-GitHub
This is Worawit Wongsena and Todsaporn Wattana-iabpan working on implementation RSA cryptography at 32bit key on Arduino.
And practical use example with nrf24L01 radio network to exchange encrypted data.
This library could encrypt and decrypt with up to 512bit key size.
If you have any question about this feel free to contact worawit.w@stelligence.com
BigNumber Library is Arbitrary precision ported by Nick Gammon 
(http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=85692.0) for key and encryped message data type.
RF24 Library is a driver of nrf24L01 by ManiacBug (https://github.com/maniacbug/RF24)
